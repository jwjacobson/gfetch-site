# gfetch-site - the homepage/devblog for the gfetch project

Find it on the web at [gfetch.dev](https://gfetch.dev)!

I'm trying to get my Gmail backup app [gfetch-cli](https://github.com/jwjacobson/gfetch-cli) verified by Google.

One of the requirements is that the app have homepage of which I am the domain owner, so this is the source code for that page! I thought it would also be interesting to blog about my experience with the Google app verification process, which is more involved than I thought.

It is built using [Django 5](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [htmx](https://htmx.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), with static files hosted via [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). It recycles a lot of material from my [portfolio](https://github.com/jwjacobson/portfolio).
