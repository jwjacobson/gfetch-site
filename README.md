# gfetch-site - the homepage/devblog for the gfetch project

I'm trying to get my Gmail backup app [gfetch-cli](https://github.com/jwjacobson/gfetch-cli) verified by Google.

One of the requirements is that the app have homepage of which I am the domain owner, so this is that page! I thought it would also be interesting to blog about my experience with the Google app verification process, which is more involved than I thought.

It is built using [Django 5](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and recycles a lot of material from my [portfolio](https://github.com/jwjacobson/portfolio).
